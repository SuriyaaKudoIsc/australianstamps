.. note::
   The rarity of a stamp is also determined by its condition, and those in pristine, unmounted mint condition usually fetch the highest prices (see also: `Australian Stamps Price List <https://www.ulastempat.com/international/the-complete-guide-to-the-australian-stamps-price-list/>`_). If you're looking to verify the authenticity and value of a rare stamp, consulting a philatelic expert or a comprehensive stamp catalogue is advised.
